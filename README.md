# Bash Profile

## Introduction

Recently, my beautiful bash profile was lost in a tragic backup accident, and I was forced to start fresh. With very little memory of what was actually in the original, I am now on a journey to terminal re-enlightenment, and you are along for the ride.

## Usage

If you just want to straight up copy my config instead of perusing it and stealing bits (which is recommended!), you can clone this repo and run the included `install.sh` file to overwrite your current config files.

Some hints on that:

- It includes `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, and `.bash_aliases`, so for god's sake, **back up your old files**.
- I use [homebrew](http://brew.sh). If you use a different package manager/build things from source/whatever, a lot of paths will need to be updated.
- You might have to change some other paths (especially ones like `/Users/Tim`, unless you happen to also be named Tim).

Note that I'm on Mac OS, and I have no idea if anything I've done is Mac specific or not, but chances are pretty good, so watch out Linux users!
